Readme

This code solves the exterior Laplace BVP in a Doubly-periodic squared domain
perineu2dnei1.m has the routine for solving the Neumann problem
peridiri2dnei1.m has the routine for solving the Dirichlet problem
Test cases used are the Elliptic Functions (Jacobi elliptic fun, Weierstrass P fun), see jacobicn.nb/weierstrass.nb for routine generating the test case data
